# AI in Medicine

As a cardiac surgeon and data scientist, I explore the intersection of **clinical medicine** and **artificial intelligence**. My work focuses on leveraging machine learning to improve patient outcomes and advance biomedical research.

## Key Areas of Interest

### Machine Learning in Biomedicine
I advocate for and apply machine learning algorithms to complex medical datasets. My goal is to develop predictive models that can assist in:
*   **Risk Stratification**: Better predicting surgical risks and outcomes.
*   **Diagnosis**: Enhancing diagnostic accuracy through pattern recognition.

### Genomic Data Science
With an MSc in Genomic Data Science, I use computational methods to analyze high-dimensional genomic data. This involves identifying genetic markers associated with **congenital heart diseases** and other cardiovascular conditions to pave the way for precision medicine.

### Reproducible Biostatistics
Transparency is key in medical research. I promote **reproducible research** practices by using code-based analysis (R, Python) instead of point-and-click software. This ensures that analyses can be audited, repeated, and built upon by the scientific community.

## Tools & Technologies
*   **Languages**: R, Python
*   **Focus**: Predictive Modeling, Biostatistics, Data Visualization
