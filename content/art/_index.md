# Musical Journey

Beyond the operating room and data labs, I am passionate about music. It serves as my creative outlet and a source of energy.

## My Instruments
My primary instrument is the **Electric Guitar**. I have been playing for years, exploring the depths of distortion, delay, and technical precision.

## Opaque Project
I am the guitarist for **Opaque Project**, a rock band based in **Massa, Italy**.
