# Rafik Margaryan, MD, PhD

**What I Do**
I am a **Consultant Cardiac Surgeon** specializing in **Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease** as well as **Adult Congenital Heart Disease**. My expertise lies in complex congenital heart repairs and minimally invasive cardiac surgery techniques. I am dedicated to improving outcomes for the youngest and most vulnerable patients.

**Where I Do It**
I currently practice at **Ospedale Del Cuore (Heart Hospital), Fondazione G. Monasterio** in **Massa, Italy**. This world-renowned center specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

**How I Do It**
I combine **clinical precision** with **data-driven innovation**. 
*   **Surgically**: I apply advanced minimally invasive techniques to reduce recovery times and improve quality of life.
*   **Scientifically**: I integrate my skills in **Genomic Data Science** and programming (R, Python) to analyze clinical data, conduct research, and push the boundaries of what is possible in cardiac care. I believe in bridging the gap between the operating room and the data lab to drive the future of medicine.
